Create linked list that stores values, 3 of them to be exact

1) First one is going to store the textures of the walls

2) Second is going to be the floor and ceiling color

3) Third is going to be the the walls and spaces , the player position

    -We're going to store the length for each line, and set the number for the malloc

4) We'll read the mini-map for the third linked list.
